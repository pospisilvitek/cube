### ðŸŸ¥ Cube

A 3D Unity game featuring a **controllable cube** in simple platforming scenes, where the **objective is to reach the end of each platform**.

---

### Description

The game consists of five scenes:

- A simple main menu  
- Level 1 (easy difficulty)  
- Level 2 (medium difficulty)  
- Level 3 (hard difficulty)  
- Final credits  

The player cube is continuously pushed forward by a preset force that cannot be altered during gameplay.

There are two types of obstacles:

- **Black solid obstacles** â€“ the player must avoid them. Touching one sends the player back to the beginning of the level.
- **Green moving obstacles** â€“ the player can touch them, but they make it harder to control the cube.

**Controls:** Press A to move left, D to move right.
